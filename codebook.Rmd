## Data Source

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset  
UCI Machine Learning Repository  
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data were collected from the accelerometers and gyroscopes of the
Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## Original Data Files

- `X_train.txt`, `X_test.txt`: sensor measurements
- `y_train.txt`, `y_test.txt`: activity labels
- `subject_train.txt`, `subject_test.txt`: subject identifiers
- `features.txt`: feature names
- `activity_labels.txt`: activity descriptions

## Variables in the Tidy Dataset

### Identifiers

- `subject`  
  Integer identifier of the subject (values 1–30)

- `activity`  
  Descriptive activity name:
  - WALKING
  - WALKING_UPSTAIRS
  - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
  - SITTING
  - STANDING
  - LAYING

### Measurements

Only measurements containing **mean()** or **std()** were retained.
These include:

- Time-domain and frequency-domain signals
- Accelerometer and gyroscope measurements
- Magnitude signals

Variable names were cleaned to be readable and descriptive (e.g.,
Time, Frequency, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Mean, StdDev).

## Transformations Performed

The following steps were performed in `analysis.R`:

1. Downloaded and unzipped the dataset
2. Merged training and test datasets
3. Extracted measurements on the mean and standard deviation
4. Replaced activity IDs with descriptive activity names
5. Cleaned and labeled variable names
6. Created a second tidy dataset by calculating the average of each
   variable for each subject and each activity
